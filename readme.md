===JINX=== 
JINX obtains PID data from the VEX Cortex, then sends the data out over a server.
The data, encoded as JSON, is then decoded client side, and plotted.

Example data includes timestamps, Error data, and command strings

JINX also includes the ability to upload command strings to the server
